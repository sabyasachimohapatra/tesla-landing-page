## Project Overview

The Product Landing Page is a web page that provides a landing page of a product. I designed this page  to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, and responsive web design principles.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing product landing page structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the product landing page.
- `images` - This folder contains all logo and image.
